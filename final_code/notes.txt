These are the notes for the final project to keep the tasks organized and keep track of what Ive done and when.

Final project concept: 
    - Creating a game based off of the childrens picture book The Adventures of Polo
    - This will be broken down into scenes that involve user interaction to "pass each level" and help Polo move 
    along through his adventure and mmake it home in the end

Scenes:
    - Leaving the house and climbing the stairs into clouds
    - Asking the cloud fisherman to take a ride down to thhe boat below
    - Riding the boat around the ocean and seeing something in the ocean below and then going down into the sea
    - Finding fish friends who give Polo the answer of how to open the chest
    - Opening the chest and finding a star and holding onto it while contuining to adventure
    - Polo finds a ship and goes inside and finds a friend who lost his key... they key so happened to be the star!
    - Polo gives him the star and the friend offers to take polo up to the surface to an island
    - At this island polo notices a grill and picks up some foood to cook over the lava 
    - After eating polo goes to the volcano which he realizes has a tunnel to the underground mushroom land 
    - In the mushroom land polo finds a glowing mushroom and holds on to it

    - The rocket takes polo home to end his great adventure!!

    - I set up the files for the code and then types out the premise and the project goals 
    - I created the sketches for each scene of the game and uploaded all of that to github just to keep a backup

    - Today I set up the class for the different friends that polo meets and polo himself 
    - I created the polo_move method which allows polo to move around the screens using the arrow keys and it also includes 
    using the + and - keys to grow and shrink polo which will help polo complete later levels. The n key resets polo's size.
    - I also created the draw_polo method which draws polo on the screen given the x and y positions given in the initializing of 
    a new friend to place polo on the screen. 
    - I also created the background for scene 1 which is just simple shapes at the moment but its fun to look at for now 
    - Within the class for the different backgrounds, I added things like stairs and sky_water which may be used several times in
    later scenes so I separated them into functions so they cann be called in multiple places.
