These are the notes for the final project to keep the tasks organized and keep track of what Ive done and when.

Final project concept: 
    - Creating a game based off of the childrens picture book The Adventures of Polo
    - This will be broken down into scenes that involve user interaction to "pass each level" and help Polo move 
    along through his adventure and mmake it home in the end

Scenes:
    - Leaving the house and climbing the stairs into clouds
    - Asking the cloud fisherman to take a ride down to thhe boat below
    - Riding the boat around the ocean and seeing something in the ocean below and then going down into the sea
    - Finding fish friends who give Polo the answer of how to open the chest
    - Opening the chest and finding a star and holding onto it while contuining to adventure
    - Polo finds a ship and goes inside and finds a friend who lost his key... they key so happened to be the star!
    - Polo gives him the star and the friend offers to take polo up to the surface to an island
    - At this island polo notices a grill and picks up some foood to cook over the lava 
    - After eating polo goes to the volcano which he realizes has a tunnel to the underground mushroom land 
    - In the mushroom land polo finds a glowing mushroom and holds on to it
    - The glowing mushroom is the key to a rocket mushroom
    - Polo says gooodbye to his mushroom friends gets inside the rocket and pushes a button
    - The rocket takes polo home to end his great adventure!!

04/22/2023:
    - I set up the files for the code and then types out the premise and the project goals 
    - I created the sketches for each scene of the game and uploaded all of that to github just to keep a backup
    
04/23/2023:
    - Today I set up the class for the different friends that polo meets and polo himself 
    - I created the polo_move method which allows polo to move around the screens using the arrow keys and it also includes 
    using the + and - keys to grow and shrink polo which will help polo complete later levels. The n key resets polo's size.
    - I also created the draw_polo method which draws polo on the screen given the x and y positions given in the initializing of 
    a new friend to place polo on the screen. 
    - I also created the background for scene 1 which is just simple shapes at the moment but its fun to look at for now 
    - Within the class for the different backgrounds, I added things like stairs and sky_water which may be used several times in
    later scenes so I separated them into functions so they cann be called in multiple places. 

04/26/2023:
    - Need to add spacebar to jump up the stairs / just jump in general 
    - Need to add the change of scenes when I touch a certain point on the screen / complete a task 
    - Need to further develop other scenes
    - Double check the comments on my code just to make sure that everything is covered 
    - IDEA: Using the speech libraries to have the instructions for the game be spoken out to the player
    instead of simply just a text box 
    - IDEA: Implement the p5.play library in order to use it for things like the collision detection or the movement of objects 

05/02/2023:
    - Trying to figure out why adding the p5.play library freezes the game from working 
        - When I run pretty much exactly the same code on a separate document it seems to work fine. I have no idea why when I 
        run it in this code it doesnt work at all
    - Figured out that it was an issue with the difference in using keycodes within the play library and now it works 
    - Added collision feature to the stairs and the rope by making them both sprites and adding the next background for the next scene

05/04/2023:
    - Trying to set up the switch in scenes through scene 1 to scene 2
    - Working on the increments of the stairs in order for them to actually look like stairs while remining responsive to polo 
    - Question: How to make every step a sprite without making individual sprites for each step 
    - Considering making the stairs just a series of rectangles rather than lines. 
    - When I remove the stairs from the scene 2 method for some reason they still draw. Im not entirely sure why this may be. They also
    appear to be unresponsive to any changing of the location even when I switch it using both variables and the sprite methods
    - Goal is to try to get polo to jump but its really not working right either and its driving me crazy 
    - A weird sprite is coming out of nowhere. Ive scavenged my code for it but for some reason its just randomly in the middle of the 
    screen when I start the sketch. I have added the start of the stairs for the new scene and only after that did it begin to show up but
    the stairs are also showing up so Im not sure what this random sprite is.
    - For some reason too the new stairs are showing up but the old stairs are also showing up even though theyre not called at all during 
    that phase of the sketch. Im really not sure what the problem is so Im gonna take a break and hope that i can catch a mistake when I 
    return to the code with fresh eyes

05/06/2023:
    - Continuing the impossible task of finishing this and fighting against every fibre of my being that is begging me to go on a walk instead
    - Questions still exist about the switching bewteen scenes and the issue with the stairs not working with the replacement and the weird
    random sprite that keeps popping up. Im going to try to sift through the code to find where these issues lie
    - The next step after fixinng the stairs would to go upto the clouds and meet the cloud man (another sprite)
        - Includes interaction with the second sprite and asking for the fishing line 
        - Try to integrate the use of a chat box as if theyre having a dialouge so that the player knows how to continue with the game
    - I dont understand why the transition to the next scene isnt working. I have looked through the code 1000 times and I cant seem to find
    anything that looks like its in the wrong place or out of the ordinary 
    - I changed the scene changes from methods in a class to simply funtions that are called and it still doesnt fix the issue with the 
    stairs being drawn twice
    - I got the stairs to either not show up or the stairs to interact with polo and I cant figure out to have BOTH occur. It seems to be a matter of 
    where I instantiate the sprites. If I start them in the setup they show up in the first scene and can interactt with polo but when I start them in 
    the functions of the stairs they dont show up but they dont interact. I have no idea what the best decicion is for this 
    - Im painfully frustrated by the stairs issue because I really cant focus on teh other levels until I can switch to the next level which involves 
    figuring out this stair problem. 
    - FINALLY got the first set of stairs to go away and now Im working on getting the steps off of he base of the stairs to work witthout spawning all
    over the place and basically infinately. 
    - I've written out the steps for each of the next scene and how I want the sprites to interact but for now Im going tp take a break and come back to 
    this either later or tomorrow 
        - First steps for when i come back will to focus on the placement of the steps up to where the cloud will be
