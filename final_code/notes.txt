These are the notes for the final project to keep the tasks organized and keep track of what Ive done and when.

Final project concept: 
    - Creating a game based off of the childrens picture book The Adventures of Polo
    - This will be broken down into scenes that involve user interaction to "pass each level" and help Polo move 
    along through his adventure and mmake it home in the end

Scenes:
    - Leaving the house and climbing the stairs into clouds
    - Asking the cloud fisherman to take a ride down to thhe boat below
    - Riding the boat around the ocean and seeing something in the ocean below and then going down into the sea
    - Finding fish friends who give Polo the answer of how to open the chest
    - Opening the chest and finding a star and holding onto it while contuining to adventure
    - Polo finds a ship and goes inside and finds a friend who lost his key... they key so happened to be the star!
    - Polo gives him the star and the friend offers to take polo up to the surface to an island
    - At this island polo notices a grill and picks up some foood to cook over the lava 
    - After eating polo goes to the volcano which he realizes has a tunnel to the underground mushroom land 
    - In the mushroom land polo finds a glowing mushroom and holds on to it
    - The glowing mushroom is the key to a rocket mushroom
    - Polo says gooodbye to his mushroom friends gets inside the rocket and pushes a button
    - The rocket takes polo home to end his great adventure!!

04/22/2023:
    - I set up the files for the code and then types out the premise and the project goals 
    - I created the sketches for each scene of the game and uploaded all of that to github just to keep a backup
    
04/23/2023:
    - Today I set up the class for the different friends that polo meets and polo himself 
    - I created the polo_move method which allows polo to move around the screens using the arrow keys and it also includes 
    using the + and - keys to grow and shrink polo which will help polo complete later levels. The n key resets polo's size.
    - I also created the draw_polo method which draws polo on the screen given the x and y positions given in the initializing of 
    a new friend to place polo on the screen. 
    - I also created the background for scene 1 which is just simple shapes at the moment but its fun to look at for now 
    - Within the class for the different backgrounds, I added things like stairs and sky_water which may be used several times in
    later scenes so I separated them into functions so they cann be called in multiple places. 

04/26/2023:
    - Need to add spacebar to jump up the stairs / just jump in general 
    - Need to add the change of scenes when I touch a certain point on the screen / complete a task 
    - Need to further develop other scenes
    - Double check the comments on my code just to make sure that everything is covered 
    - IDEA: Using the speech libraries to have the instructions for the game be spoken out to the player
    instead of simply just a text box 
    - IDEA: Implement the p5.play library in order to use it for things like the collision detection or the movement of objects 

05/02/2023:
    - Trying to figure out why adding the p5.play library freezes the game from working 
        - When I run pretty much exactly the same code on a separate document it seems to work fine. I have no idea why when I 
        run it in this code it doesnt work at all
    - Figured out that it was an issue with the difference in using keycodes within the play library and now it works 
    - Added collision feature to the stairs and the rope by making them both sprites and adding the next background for the next scene

05/04/2023:
    - Trying to set up the switch in scenes through scene 1 to scene 2
    - Working on the increments of the stairs in order for them to actually look like stairs while remining responsive to polo 
    - Question: How to make every step a sprite without making individual sprites for each step 
    - Considering making the stairs just a series of rectangles rather than lines. 
    - When I remove the stairs from the scene 2 method for some reason they still draw. Im not entirely sure why this may be. They also
    appear to be unresponsive to any changing of the location even when I switch it using both variables and the sprite methods
    - Goal is to try to get polo to jump but its really not working right either and its driving me crazy 
    - A weird sprite is coming out of nowhere. Ive scavenged my code for it but for some reason its just randomly in the middle of the 
    screen when I start the sketch. I have added the start of the stairs for the new scene and only after that did it begin to show up but
    the stairs are also showing up so Im not sure what this random sprite is.
    - For some reason too the new stairs are showing up but the old stairs are also showing up even though theyre not called at all during 
    that phase of the sketch. Im really not sure what the problem is so Im gonna take a break and hope that i can catch a mistake when I 
    return to the code with fresh eyes

05/06/2023:
    - Continuing the impossible task of finishing this and fighting against every fibre of my being that is begging me to go on a walk instead
    - Questions still exist about the switching bewteen scenes and the issue with the stairs not working with the replacement and the weird
    random sprite that keeps popping up. Im going to try to sift through the code to find where these issues lie
    - The next step after fixinng the stairs would to go upto the clouds and meet the cloud man (another sprite)
        - Includes interaction with the second sprite and asking for the fishing line 
        - Try to integrate the use of a chat box as if theyre having a dialouge so that the player knows how to continue with the game
    - I dont understand why the transition to the next scene isnt working. I have looked through the code 1000 times and I cant seem to find
    anything that looks like its in the wrong place or out of the ordinary 
    - I changed the scene changes from methods in a class to simply funtions that are called and it still doesnt fix the issue with the 
    stairs being drawn twice
    - I got the stairs to either not show up or the stairs to interact with polo and I cant figure out to have BOTH occur. It seems to be a matter of 
    where I instantiate the sprites. If I start them in the setup they show up in the first scene and can interactt with polo but when I start them in 
    the functions of the stairs they dont show up but they dont interact. I have no idea what the best decicion is for this 
    - Im painfully frustrated by the stairs issue because I really cant focus on teh other levels until I can switch to the next level which involves 
    figuring out this stair problem. 
    - FINALLY got the first set of stairs to go away and now Im working on getting the steps off of he base of the stairs to work witthout spawning all
    over the place and basically infinately. 
    - I've written out the steps for each of the next scene and how I want the sprites to interact but for now Im going tp take a break and come back to 
    this either later or tomorrow 
        - First steps for when i come back will to focus on the placement of the steps up to where the cloud will be

05/07/2023:
    - Started by adding just an image of stairs instead of rectangles 
    - Considering adding some sort of balls in order to make the player go up the stairs
    - When I put in the image of the cloud for some reason it removes all of the background of scene 2
        - When I remove the image of the cloud everything works just fine but when I add the image it breaks it
        - When the background is removed I can also see that the polo sprite and two others which im assuming are the rope and the scene 1 stairs are 
        infinately spawning in the background. I dont know how to get that to stop happening without theh sprites either going away or losing their 
        functionality 
    - This is all proving to be much more difficult than I originally intended and its drivibg me sort of mad
    - The rod_lines isnt working right because there is a random sprite in the first scene and then it looks fine in the second scene but there are polo
    sprites spawning in the backround of the scene and the movements all slow down from the volume of the sprites
    - I changed the rod from a sprite to simply just a line and that all seems o work a bit better
    - I dont know what to do because if the balls are in dynamic mode theres a trillion of them but if theyre in kinematic mode then they are unable to be
    moved. I cant find anything on what Im supposed to do here with this because it doesnt seem to be working regardless 
    - Once I am able to remove the balls then I can add a counter so I can trade the balls for a ride down the cloudman's fishing poll (Its like bait)

05/08/2023:
    - Critique notes:
        - Add a counter to see how much bait polo has collected 
        - Load steps as individual sprites into an array in order to be able to add gravity and collision
        - Add better graphics 
        - Add sound effects
        - Use for loops in order to check for the collision 
        - Make the interactivity purposeful 
        - Add a couple more ellipses in order to make the cloud look more cloud like 
        - Background music?? Focus on getting the project to work first but this is something to think about 

05/10/2023:
    - Create reactivity with the bait so that polo can collect them 
    - I changed the balls so that they are spawned using a for loop. However, now they are showing up as rectangles not as balls and they are spawning
    infinately again not just the singular ball amount. I dont necessarily understand why this is as he for loop should only create 8 sprites. I dont 
    understand why the sprites are multiplying if they are not set in any way to do that
    - I made a slight change and instead of setting group color and shape I set it within the for loop where the balls are created and that seems to work
    - I think it is an issue with the collider type because if I change the collider to dynamic it spawns extra but it responds to the collisions however
    when I change it to k or s then it doesnt spawn extra but it also wont allow me to collect the balls
    - Im going to explode I feel like everytime I get one thing to work something else goes comepletely wrong. I dont know where to go with the balls issue
    - I have begun mapping out the other scenes of the game in detail in my notebook while Im trying to figure out the issue with the balls just to keep
    my process rolling on this

05/11/2023:
    - Heres my thoughts today. I am thinking I need to simply delete the scene with the balls and the cloudman and simply go into the next scene with the
    boat. I am running out of time to finish this and I think I need to adjust my vision with the project because finished is better than perfect.
    Im disappointed in myself for having to cut corners but to be honest  I think it shows a lot of growth in me because earlier in the semester I would 
    agoonized over this and given up because it wasnt perfect so to decide I need to just keep moving forward is massive growth for me. 
    - "Starting over" with scene 2 by going straight to the boat
    - Added the boat and connected the line from the first scene to lead polo to the boat
    - When polo goes to the boat polo must collect the  underwater suit (im sure theres a real name for this but i cant think of it lol)
    - Polo collecting the suit triggers the scene change to being underwater
    - Even when I use the remove method on both the boat and the helmet it still doesnt remove them. It doesnt matter where I place them and even if I 
    put it in the same place as when I removed the rope and the stairs for whatever reason they dont react even though they are essentially the same
    just pngs rather than shapes. Is that the difference? The sprite type? 
    - Even when I move the boat and helmet the original location of the boat and the helmet remain there and dont move which makes me think theyre spawning
    on top of eachother 
    - I got the boat and helmet to work how I want them to by using the visible method.

05/11/2023 (Working on Scene 3): 
    - Polo is now wearing the helmet when underwater and the helmet flips in accordance to which direction polo is moving in
    - Now implementing the treasure box and the fish friends 
    - Scene 3 is where the bulk of the interaction for the game begins as teh first two scenes are set up for the game and scene 3 is where the functions
    of an actual game begins. 
    - I added one fish and got it to loop back and forth within the bounds of the window. Im in the process of trying to add a few fish but either I have 
    1 fish or I have an infinate amount that keeps multiplying and I really just want like 10 so idk what the deal is here 
    - I got the normal fish to work how I want them to work now Im adding the special fish who gives the key!
    - I got the special fish to work properly as well as the text box with instructions so the player knows what to do
    - If you click on the special fish she gives you the key to open the treasure box
    - The key opens the treasure box and the treasure box has a star in it. When you collect the star it triggers the next scene

05/11/2023 (Working on Scene 4):
    - Scene 4 starts with a submarine/ship thing on the ceneter of the screen and the fish and other things leaving the screen 
    - Added the captain of the ship so that you can click on the ship and the captain  comes out to speak with you 
    - The next step is to trade the star (which is the key for the space shuttle) for a ride to the next part of the adventure
    - Ive made a lot of progress for tonight and Im going to take a break until tomorrow. Tomorrow I must finish this so ill pick up after work 

05/12/2023:
    - Working on the interactions between polo and the ship captain in scene 4.
    - For some reason when the ship is clicked and the captain leaves the ship to speak to polo, polo loses his ability to move
    - Before clicking on the sub, polo can move perfectly fine, however after clicking on the submarine, polo is stuck in place. When looking at my code 
    I dont see anywhere that would reflect the change in polos movement and when I look at the developer there seems to be an error i the planck which I
    am unfamiliar with 
    - Everything up until here works and the next steps include a series of yes or no questions for the player to interact with in order to get to the 
    second to last scene
    - Do you want a ride?
        - No > leads back to do you want a ride 
        - Yes > I heard you have the star key to my ship!
            - No > leads back to do you want a ride?
            - Yes > polo gives over the star and they both go to the ship 
                - Scene 4 ends with the ship taking flight and going to the mushroom world
    - The last full scene is the mushroom world and there you find the mushroom rocket that brings polo back to his home
    - Once polo is home the game is over
    - I have everything mapped out I just need to figure out this movement thing so the scenes can continue on
    - Ive figured out the interaction of polo and the captain and I have also gotten the question and answer sequence to work so the player has to interact
    with the game in order to have the captain give a ride to polo 
    - I finished scene 4 and now im working on scene 5 which will take polo home
